### Lyrics

```

	I’m proud of the colour of my eyes
	I’m proud of all the stuff I buy
	I’m proud of my country
	Proud of my family

	I’m proud of what I am
	Don’t tell me what I do
	I’m so proud to be
	A Lottery Winner

	Don’t tell me what I do
	Just look at what I am.
	
	I was born in here
	This was the good ticket
	I deserved to win, I guess
	I deserved to win, I know

	I’m proud of what I am
	Don’t tell me what I do
	I’m so proud to be
	A Lottery Winner
	
	I’m proud of my blue jeans
	I’m proud of my genes

	I’m proud of what I am
	Don’t tell me what I do
	I’m so proud to be
	A lottery Winner

	I made the good choice
	And I won’t share my gains!
	We drew the winning ticket
	Why didn't they do the same?
	
	I made the good choice
	And I won’t share my gains!
	We drew the winning ticket
	Why didn't they do the same?

### Lyrics


```

	It was crying
	That awoke me that night
	Your final fight
	Had come to an end

	You wouldn't have wanted us sad
	But who can be that strong
	Nothing can balance your loss 
	You're just not here.
	Or only in my heart.

	You said you had 
	Just for a while
	But knew you would
	Never come back.

	I know that you can’t here me
	I know it’s just a sad song
	But I just want to yell
	That I love you
	
	And if you’re not here
	I’m still you.
	If you’re not here
	I’m still you.

### Lyrics

```

	He was talking to the clouds
	felt he was knocked out in the first round
	Alone, he missed someone who understands

	She was talking to the trees
	felt she was unknown poetry
	Alone, she missed someone who understands
	
	And hopefully 
	clouds talk to trees
	And they told the lonely hearts 
	they knew someone just right for them
	
	And now that they found
	each other's hands
	They're talking to the stars
	Floating around
	in outer space
	they're truly living

### Lyrics

```

	One day, you’re laughing and smiling
	The day after, you’re dead!
	One day you’re riding or biking
	Then a truck drive over your head!
	One day you’re happy singing
	The day after, you’d better pray instead!
	One day you’re kissing, you’re loving
	The day after, she’s dead…
	
	Who’s gonna die today?
	Maybe me… maybe you…
	Sometimes people die!
	Sometimes it’s even real people that you know,
	and it’s sad! so sad
	But sometimes it’s just other people
	that other people know
	And you don’t care!
	
	One day, you’re laughing and smiling
	The day after, you’re dead!
	One day you’re heart is beating
	Then it’s stone-dead
	One day the life light is green
	Then it turns red…
	One day you get a new painting
	The day after, you get a cancer instead
	Who’s gonna die today?
	Maybe me… maybe you…
	
	Sometimes people die!
	Sometimes it’s even real people that you know,
	and it’ s sad! so sad
	But sometimes it’s just other people
	that other people know
	And you don’t care!

### Lyrics

```

	You're laying in your sleep
	I hear you breathing and nothing matters. 

	The fear at night
	Of what could go wrong
	The fear of losing you
	Your love your arms

	And how could I forget
	The threat in every day! 
	And how could I forget
	The threat in every day! 

	You're laying in your sleep
	I hear you breathing and nothing matters. 
	
	The fear at night
	Of what could go wrong
	The fear of losing you
	Your love your arms

	And how could I forget
	The threat in every day! 
	And how could I forget
	The threat in every day!

### Lyrics

```
	
	Nobody notices me
	Except when I’m out with my python
	I enjoy people looking at me
	But they’re afraid and they call the police

	But I’m gonna get married with
	This girl from the islands
	She knows that I exist
	She smiles at me in  the lift 

	I live in a demographic city
	Try to be one among millions
	I feel so dangerously close to zero
	that I wish I could be just two

	When the world is missing outside,
	there’s still my python by my side
	It coils up around my heat with no harm
	Hugs my body with its long arm

   	But I’m gonna get married with
	This girl from the islands
	She knows that I exist
	She smiles at me in  the lift 

	Each morning at the office, I wait
	for her to get into the same lift
	She’s wearing boots and a mini-skirt
	Each floor is a stop on our lovers’ trip

   	But I’m gonna get married with
	This girl from the islands
	She knows that I exist
	She smiles at me in  the lift 

	And I do my best silence
	While we’re travelling in the lift

### Lyrics

```

	My world is a friend,
	So close and familiar,
	That I could think,
	It was born with me.

	My world 's filled with men,
	Whose behavior seems so natural,
	Cause it's the one 
	I have always seen. 

	My world yet was built
	By million men brains and hearts
	And blood .
	My world is fragile, 
	And we can come back again,
	As history can tell, 
	Barbarians. 

	Where would I run ?
	Where would I hide ?
	Who would I kill to save my folks ?
	When my world .... has come back to wild.

### Lyrics

```

    Watching TV makes me busy
    Video Games makes me busy
    News of the wold make me busy
    It's seems that life is easy

    I'm entertained, and hours
    Pour like seconds, wherever  
    And when my last day has come
    I'll wonder where They're all gone
    
    Everyday work makes me busy
    Looking for sex makes me busy
    News of the world make me busy
    It's seems that life is easy

    I'm entertained, and hours
    Pour like seconds, wherever  
    And when my last day has come
    I'll wonder where They're all gone

### Lyrics


```

	It's easy to be mean or intolerant
	Always have someone to blame is convenient 
	It's easy to fall in love and to have friends
	Easy to find people to hate or even kill

	It's not easy to love 
	people we don't know
	But it's the only way
	For us to live in peace
	We say it's a foolish dream
	When we don't want to try

	What if God was a sparse consciousness
	that universal love is the safe way to go
	Ans as it's opposite to our natural instinct
	We believe this thought is coming from above

	It's not easy to care 
	for who don't care for us
	But it's the only way
	For us to live in peace
	Think of them as ourselves
	Don't we want to be loved ?
	
	It's not easy to love 
	people we don't know
	But it's the only way
	For us to live in peace
	We say it's a foolish dream
	When we don't want to try

### Lyrics


```

	Once i met an old man planting a tree
	in its garden and i wondered why 
	He said he always liked to live is life as if
	he would never die eventually
	That was a surprise, i thought how interesting
	I used to do the other way around
	I always live as if I'll die tommorrow
	
	You wish you had time
	to do nothing
	You wish you had time
	to do more things
	
	Should I jump in
	Add my own melody
	Or should I just sit
	And enjoy the music
	Is it best to be a bird
	fighting gravity
	Or a snake feeling earth
	all along its body
	
	You wish you had time
	to do nothing
	You wish you had time
	to do more things
	
	
```
